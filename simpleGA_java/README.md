## The Simple Genetic Algorithm
This Java code (partly) implements the simple Genetic Algorithm (GA) described in assignment 1.

## Compiling & Running
You can use an IDE to compile and run this code, or do it manually.
Netbeans will automatically recognize the folder as a Java project.

To compile manually, execute `make` from your terminal (works on both Linux and Windows).
An example running script is provided as `./run.sh`.

## How are the folders organized?
All `.java` source code files are in `src/geneticalgorithm`. All compiled classes will end up in `build/classes/geneticalgorithm`.
When the code is run, a folder `experiments` will be created, where useful information will be logged.
